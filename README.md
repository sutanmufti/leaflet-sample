# Sample Leaflet Code

working sample of static map with leaflet.

leaflet js with legend.

leaflet js map from geojson javascript module.


how it works:

the geojson acts as a javascript module, so we can read from the "file system". This means we can read the files in the directories. This wouldn't have been possible if it was an ordinary ```.geojson```.
